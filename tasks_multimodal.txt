DON'T FORGET TO PULL CHANGES BEFORE STARTING WRITING THE CODE
THE PERSON WHO HAS THE KINECT DEVICE MAY RUN THE WHOLE CODE ONCE PER SOME DAYS :D

For Milestone:
* Implement left hand - push/hover button property
OK * Don't change color only when cursor is hovering, once it touches the button it changes and stays that way.
* Left hand cursor has to be drawn as a cursor, not painting
OK * Menu on the left: 6-color palette - each color is picked on hover of the left hand.
* Maybe implement the same thing for cursor input, for debugging reasons.

Basic Tasks:
* Start / Stop Drawing : !!! RECOGNIZE GESTURE OF LEFT HAND FOR THAT
* Implement background : Show the camera input instead of a blank paper
* Basic Menu on the left:
	* Tool 1 - Brush stroke button(light, normal, bold)
	* Tool 2 - Eraser button
	* Tool 3 - Color Picker button(first choose between 6 colors)
	* Tool 4 - What else?

Additional Tasks: (Add what you want here, some cool stuff, everyone can pick one or more and implement it)
* Transparency
(* Add more people )
